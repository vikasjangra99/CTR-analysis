# CTR-Analysis


## Project Description:
Click Through Rate in Digital Advertising is one of the most important metrics. It measures the number of clicks a particular advertiser received on their ad per the number of impressions (impressions = number of times the ad was shown to a user). It gives a broad view to the advertiser on how well their ad is received by the users. 

Following are some of the reasons why CTR is important for advertisers:

• Gives a base of potential users who will convert

• Helps create a benchmark rate for future ad campaigns

• Aids in understanding which ad copy works better, from a call-to-action point of view

• Understand the dynamics and behavior of the target audience


## Assumptions:

**Label: represents the status of clicking.**

0 - not clicked

1 - Clicked


**inter_type_cd: represents the display form of the ad.**

3 - Image

4 - GIF

5 - Videos

**Gender**:

0 - Female

1 - Male

2 - Others


**Slot_id: represents the placement of the ad on the screen.**

11 to 22 - represents the various location of the ad placement.


**Net_type: represents the status of the net.**

2 to 6 - 2 being the weakest and 6 being the strongest.


**City_rank: represents Level of the resident city of a user**

2 to 5: 2 being the lowest and 5 being highest.
