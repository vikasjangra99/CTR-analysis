# CTR-Analysis


## Project Description:
Click Through Rate in Digital Advertising is one of the most important metrics. It measures the number of clicks a particular advertiser received on their ad per the number of impressions (impressions = number of times the ad was shown to a user). It gives a broad view to the advertiser on how well their ad is received by the users. 

Following are some of the reasons why CTR is important for advertisers:

• Gives a base of potential users who will convert

• Helps create a benchmark rate for future ad campaigns

• Aids in understanding which ad copy works better, from a call-to-action point of view

• Understand the dynamics and behavior of the target audience
